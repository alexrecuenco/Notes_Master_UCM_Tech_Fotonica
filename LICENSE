No license ‚Äî 2022

This is not a legal document, nor has it been written by anyone licensed to practice law anywhere.

NOT LICENSED, Therefore, as far as I am aware, default copyright laws apply to **original** work, meaning that:

- I retain all rights to the source code
- No one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from my work.

The templates in which the folder structures are based will be made available independently to be used for your own notes.

If anyone ever reads this, first of all *HIII*, second of all, if you want to use any of it, contact me.

In those places in which code is not mine, it should fall under fair use for education purposes, and sources and credit should be found next to them.

(However, these are just personal notes I don't expect anyone to ever use, so if I fall short of that standard, please forgive me üê∂)
