Slide 23

matlab, the `s' is important to make it simulate an analog signal, rather than digital

slide 24

Change from low to high pass through transformation

slide 29, transformation produce an output signal, that will usually be delayed

Slide 30

Phase delay, group delay. The `$-$' sign i because the difference is already negative, this negative sign makes the qantity negtive when there is a delay


If phase delay is linear, the group delay is constant. When the wave is reconstructed, it won't be affected.
If what is constant is the delay, note that a higher frequency means a bigger phase delay, since it is proportional to the frequency

If you have a phase delay that is not linear, the group delay will change, and you can see how that affects the signal

Start taking notes on document until we transfer to LaTeX our notes


Notes on lab

Diagram and analysis of diagram, analyze results, not whatever signal thingy it is

So that the area is one on an instagram.
