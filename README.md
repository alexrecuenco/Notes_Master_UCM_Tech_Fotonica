# Notes Master UCM Technology & Photonics.

## Reminder

These notes are relevant with respect to some material and programming part of those courses, they are not reflections of the content of these courses and should not be use to evaluate them in any way.

The courses are in Spanish, so there will be some translation lag to standard technical language in English, and in some parts there may be some Spanish words used.

## External resources

All external resources can't be uploaded here, when possible there will be a reference to it.

## Start

This project is meant to be carried out within VS Code. It should start by getting `workspace/workspace.code-workspace` opened on vscode


## Build

The goal is to have some automations run on *individual courses* . For that purpose we will hope to use github actions that only apply when changes are made on a certain folder.`
